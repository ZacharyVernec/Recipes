- 1 | tsp Cumin
- 1 | tsp roasted Garlic Powder *or regular garlic powder, or toasted garlic powder, or 3x roasted minced fresh garlic*
- 1 | tsp All spice
- Salt & Pepper

directions:

- Chop garlic, dice the onion.
- Saute onion (high heat for 7 minutes until evely brown). Brown garlic in last 30 seconds, then add to a large bowl.
- Drain and rinse chickpeas, then add to same bowl.
- Again in the same bowl, add in all remaining ingredients for the wet seitan.
- Blend wet seitan mix until as homogenous/smooth as possible.
- In a different bowl, mix dry seitan ingredients.
- Now pour blended mix into bowl with dry mix, and form a ball of dough.
- Knead for 10 minutes (not less), being extra firm with it. 
- Flatten and form into a long rectangle patty (similar to the shape of ribs) punching, slapping. #TODO shape
- Cut in half and leave to rest while bbq sauce is being prepared.
- Roast garlic.
- In a bowl, mix tomato ketchup, english mustard, balsamic vinegar, liquid smoke, soy sauce, coconut sugar, all spice, cumin, roasted garlic powder, salt, pepper
- Add in a good quality sweet cola. Will look runny, but don't worry as it will cook.
- Preheat gridle pan.
- Add a touch of smoked olive oil to grill.
- Coat one side of the dough in bbq sauce with a spoon.
- Grill dough with the sauce covered side face down. Want to hear sizzling, make sure there is char (about 2 minutes on medium-high). While grilling, coat the remaining dough side in bbq sauce. After a couple minutes, flip.
- Once both patties are grilled, add to baking tray. Coat with remaining bbq sauce. Add bay leaf and star anis.
- Bake in oven at 320F (160C) for 2 hours, flipping halfway.
- Chop up the ribs in 1" strips (like ribs). Spoon cooked sauce at bottom of the pan on top.
- Either serve, or keep in freezer for up to 3months (only need to reheat), or leave overnight in the fridge (may be even more tender)

#TODO when to preheat oven.
