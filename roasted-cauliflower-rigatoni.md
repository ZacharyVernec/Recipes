ingredients: #TODO reorder according to use
- 1| medium cauliflower
- 4| medium garlic cloves *divided*
- 5| tablespoons olive oil *divided*
- 1| teaspoon red pepper flakes *divided*
- 4| portions of rigatoni *consult package*
- 4| tablespoons roasted almond powder *pre-roasted not necessary*
- 3| tablespoons pickled capers #TODO quantify in mL for ease of buying
- 1/4| cups of fresh flat-leaf parsley *roughly chopped, possibly more* #TODO quantify for ease of buying
- 1/2| lemon
- salt and pepper *to taste*
- parmesan *grated, to serve*

notes: 
- If pasta is ready earlier than the cauliflower, cool it by running cold water over it to prevent overcooking. The pasta will then need to be reheated more thorougly after mixing all ingredients. Do so on medium heat. #TODO describe how long

directions:
- Preheat your oven to 450°F (230°C).
- Prepare cauliflower by removing the stem and cutting into small florets #TODO describe small
- Mince the garlic.
- On a large rimmed baking sheet covered in parchement paper, toss cauliflower with 2 tablespoons olive oil, half of the garlic, half of the red pepper flakes, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Make sure cauliflower is in a single layer.
- Cook cauliflower for 15-20 minutes on center rack, tossing halfway, until golden brown.
- Cook pasta according to package in generously salted water, until al dente but not more. Drain, reserving around 1 cup of pasta water.
- While the pasta cooks, if almond powder is not roasted, do so now. Dry-roast powder on a small pan on medium heat until golden brown. Careful not to burn.
- While the pasta cooks, rinse and dry the capers.
- While the pasta cooks, roughly chop, scissor, or tear the parsley.
- In the empty pot in which the pasta was previously cooked, heat 3 tablespoons of olive oil. Add remaining garlic, remaining red pepper flakes, and capers and cook for 1 minute (until garlic is pale golden). In the last 30 seconds, add the capers to crisp. Add around half a cup of pasta water to halt cooking.
- Add the pasta and cauliflowers to the pot and mix.
- Add the juice and zest of the lemon. Add the parsley.
- Add salt, pepper and additional pasta water to taste and texture.
- Serve, topped with roasted almond powder, parmesan, and possibly any previously used ingredients, to taste and visual pleasure.
